# Random Process

A random process is defined as the function mapping the result of probability experiment to the time function. It is written as:

<center>

$X(t)\equiv X(t, e)$
</center>

And random variable $X\equiv X(e)$ is defined as the function mapping the result of probability $e$ to the real number.
