# Deep SORT

Deep SORT integrates appearance information to improve the performance of SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking). As SORT did, Deep SORT also places much of the computational complexity into an offline pre-training stage, where it learns a deep association metric on a large-scale person re-identification dataset. During online application, Deep SORT establishes measurement-to-track associations using nearest neighbor queries in the visual appearance space.
