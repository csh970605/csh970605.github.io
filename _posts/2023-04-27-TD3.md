# What is Twin Delayd DDPG(TD3)?


TD3 double learns with one optimal value, and the doulbe learning includes an [actor model](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Actor_Critic/) and two [critic models](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Actor_Critic/). And also [policy gradient](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Policy_Gradient/) is used to update actor model through the Q values optimized by critic model.
