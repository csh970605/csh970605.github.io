# Simple Online and Realtime Tracking(SORT)

[SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763) is a novel multi object tracking algorithm that disunite detector and assigner unlike other traditional tracking algorithms.<br>
There is one more thing that different from other traditional tracking algorithms, they used simple but efficient methods which are [Kalman filter](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Kalman_Filter/) and [Hungarian method](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Hungarian_Method/) to handle the motion prediction and data association components of the tracking problems.<br>
And also, as the name suggests (Online Tracking), SORT is a method of performing detection response association to form a tracking trajectory using only object detection information of past and current frames without information about future frames.<br>
<br><br><br><br>


# Methodologies

The proposed method is described by the key components of:

+ Detection

+ Propagating object states into future frames(Estimation Model)

+ Associating current detections with existing objects(Data Association)

+ Managing the lifespan of tracked objects

<br><br>

## Detection

As I mentioned in the first paragraph, they used detection frameworks. It might be strange since it was made a long time ago, but at that time, using VGG16 was the best according to their experiences.<br>
We can see the comparsion of tracking performance by switching the detectors:

</center>
<br><br>

## Estimation Model

To achieve the online tracking, they designed that a representation and motion model that is used to propagate a target's identity into the next frame.<br>
They calculated the inter-frame displacements of each object with a linear constant velocity model that is independent of othe objects and camera motion.<br>
The state of each target is:

<center>

$x = [u, v, s, r, \dot{u}, \dot{v}, \dot{s}]^T$
</center>
where 

+ $u$ : Horizontal pixel location of the center of the target.

+ $v$ : Vertical pixel location of the center of the target.

+ $s$ : Scale of the target's bounding box.

+ $r$ : Aspect ratio of the target's bounding box.

+ $\dot{u}$ : Future horizontal pixel location of the center of the target.

+ $\dot{v}$ : Future vertical pixel location of the center of the target.

+ $\dot{s}$ : Future scale of the target's bounding box.

    ※Note that *r* is considered to be constant.

<br><br>

If adetection is associated to a target, the detected bounding box is used to update the target state($u, v, s, r$) where the velocity components are solved optimally via Kalman filter.<br>
If a detection is not associated to the target, its state is simply predicted without correction using the linear velocity model.<br>
<br><br>

## Data Association

This step involves assigning detections to existing targets. That is, each target's bounding box geometry is estimated by predicting its new location in the current frame.<br>
As other assigners do, SORT also needs assignment cost matrix which is computed as the [IOU](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/IOU_Loss/) distance between each detection and all predicted bounding boxes from the existing targets. Here, the hungarian algorithm is used to solve the assignment optimally.<br>
And also, $IOU_{min}$ is used to reject assignments where the detection to  target overlap $\leq IOU_{min}$<br>

But, weakness also exists. When the target is occluded by other object, only the occluder would be detected because the IOU distance appropriately favours detections with similar scale.
<br><br>

## Managing the lifespan of tracked objects

To distinguish objects, it is necessary that unique identities need to be created or destroyed.<br>
In this paper, when trackers are created, they considered any detection with an overlap less than $IOU_{min}$ to signify the existence of an untracked object as I mentioned in [Data Association section](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/SORT/#data-association).<br>
Then, let's take a look at what happens when creating and deleting trackers.
<br><br>

### Creating Trackers

The trackers are initialised using the geometry of the bounding box with the velocity set to zero. Because the velocity is unobserved at this point the covariance of the velocity component is initialised with large values, reflecting this uncertainty.<br>
Then, the new trackers undergo a probationary period where the targets need to be associated with detections to accumulate enough evidences in order to prevent tracking of *false positives*.
<br><br>

### Deleting Trackers

Trackers are deleted if they are not detected for $T_{Lost}$ frames. This method prevents an abounded grwoth in the number of trackers and localization errors caused by predictions over long durations without corrections from the detector.<br>

# Performance

They evaluated the performance of SORT by using FRCNN(VGG16) and MOT benchmark database. <br>
They got:

where:
+ MOTA(↑) : Multi object tracking accuracy.
+ MOTP(↑) : Multi object tracking precision.
+ FAF(↓) : Number of false alarms per frame.
+ MT(↑) : Number of mostly tracked trajectories. For example, target has the same label for at least 80% of its life span.
+ ML(↓) : Number of mostly lost trajectoreis. For example, target is not tracked for at least 20% of its life span.
+ FP(↓) : Number of false detections.
+ FN(↓) : Number of missed detections.
+ ID sw(↓) : Number of times an ID switches to a different previously tracked object.
+ Frag(↓) : Number of fragmentations where a track is interrupted by miss detection.

    Note that ↑ means higher scores denote better performance and ↓ means lower scores denote better performance.

As you can see at the image above, the performance of SORT is not the best because there is a trade-off between online and performance. Since SORT is deisgned to be used at realtime application such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. Then, let's see the difference between batch type and online type.

<br><br>

## Batch Tracking Type

The batch tracking method performs repeated detection response association for all object information detected in the entire frame to form the entire tracking trajectory.<br>
Because it forms a tracking trajectory using object detection information for the entire frame, it shows better tracking performance than online tracking methods.
However, it is difficult to apply to real-time applications because object detection information for the entire frame must be obtained in advance.

## Online Tracking Type

The online tracking method uses only object detection information from past and current frames without information about future frames to perform detection response association to form a tracking trajectory.<br>
Therefore, the online tracking method is more suitable for real-time applications than the batch tracking method.
Due to the absence of future frame information, online tracking methods are vulnerable to long-term occlusion or changes in object appearance, making it difficult to associate detection responses to form tracking trajectories.
This causes track fragmentation and identity switches, which reduces tracking performance.

# Conclusion

SORT shows that existing tracking algorithms perform well when the tracker is combined with a SOTA detector.<br>
However, because it is an online tracking method, it has weaknesses such as occlusions.
