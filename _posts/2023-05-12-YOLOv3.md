# What is YOLOv3?
YOLO is similar as [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/). But there are no Flattening layers in YOLO.<br>
The basic structure of YOLO is:

</center>
<br><br>
As you can see in the image above, the goal of YOLO is to generate the bounding box in order to detect the position of the object.<br>

In the process of YOLO, **Concatenation** occurs which copies the image and joins it before applying the preprocessing steps. And the concatenation makes us look powerful in order to detect objects.<br>
And **Residual Blocks** are the convolutional layers.<br><br>
There is a advantage of detecting the same object as different size, YOLO can detect smaller objects well.

# Implementation

+ [Object tracking with YOLO](https://github.com/csh970605/Computer-Vision-Masterclass/tree/main/Section%209) : I used darknet to implement it.<br>

+ [YOLOv3 in using cv2.dnn.readNetFrom()](https://github.com/csh970605/Modern_Computer_Vision/blob/main/OpenCV/33.%20YOLOv3%20in%20OpenCV.ipynb)
