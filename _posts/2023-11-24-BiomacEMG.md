# What is BiomacEMG?

BiomacEMG is a concept that is suggested by [Article](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/9/5744).
<br>
In the article, biomacEMG classifies 7 handgestures with Machine Learning. <br>
Then, let's see how it works.
<br><br><br><br>


# What is EMG?

EMG(electromyography) is a type of physiological signal recording that detects electrical signals from muscle fibres in response to gestures or movements.<br>

# What does BiomacEMG do?

The article uses surface electrodes to collect electromyographic (EMG) data from
the forearm flexion and extension muscles, which were used as input parameters to the
machine learning algorithms to recognize seven hand gestures.<br>

Since EMG signals are erratic, signal analysis performance is generally poor, they measure different types of muscle gropus in real time. Which is:

+ The carpi radials of the muscle flexor are responsible for the flexion and radial deviation of the wrist.<br>

+ Musculus flexor pollicis longus, which is responsible for the flexion of the pollicis.<br>

+ The carpi radials of the muscle flexor are responsible for the flexion and radial deviation of the wrist.<br>

+ Musculus flexor pollicis longus, which is responsible for the flexion of the pollicis.<br>

+ Musculus flexor digitorum, which is responsible for flexion of the fingers.<br>

+ The carpi ulnaris muscle flexor, which is responsible for flexion and ulnar deviation
of the wrist.<br>

+ Muscuclus extensor pollicis longus at brevis, which is responsible for the extension of
pollicis.<br>

+ The carpi ulnaris muscle extensor is responsible for extension and ulnar deviation of
the wrist.<br>
+ Musculus extensor digitorum, that is responsible for extension of the fingers.<br>

+ Musculus extensor carpi radialis, which is responsible for extension and radial deviation of the wrist.<br>

You can see which muscles are used in the pictures below:
