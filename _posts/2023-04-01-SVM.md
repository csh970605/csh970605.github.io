# What is SVM?

Like [Support Vector for Regression(SVR)](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/SVR/), there is a straight line called Maximum Margin between two categories.<br>
The **Maximum Margin Hyperplane** is drawn at exactly the same distance as the two nearest points in each category.<br>
And the two nearest points are called **Support Vectors**.<br>
As you can see image below, a straight line parallel to the maximum margin hyperplane and passing through the support vector becomes a **hyperplane**. <br>
And hyperplane will support the decision boundary which is called Maximu Margine.<br>

<br>
Thus, new data is classified according to whether it is in the negative or positive hyperplane.<br>

# Example
<br><br>

## Code
---
<br>

```py
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

classifier = SVC(kernel='linear') # you can change kernel if you want other model
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
```
