# Mobile ALOHA

Deep SORT integrates appearance information to improve the performance of SORT(Simple Online and Realtime Tracking).<br>

As SORT did, deep SORT also place much of the computational complexity into an offline pre-training stage where they learn a deep association metric on a large scale person re-identification dataset.<br>

During online application, deep SORT establish measurement-to-track associations using nearest neighbor queries in visual appearance space.<br>
