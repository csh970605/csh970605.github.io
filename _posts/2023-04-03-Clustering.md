# What is Clustering?<br>

Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset.<br>
It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."

# Pros and cons of clustering models
<br>

| Clustering Model | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K-Means | Easy to understand.<br>Easy to apply.<br>Works great regardless of size.<br>Fast, efficient and high performance. | The number of clusters must be determined. |
| Hierarchical Clustering | The optimal number of clusters can be obtained from the model itself.<br>Practical visualization through dendrogram. | Not suitable for large data sets. |
