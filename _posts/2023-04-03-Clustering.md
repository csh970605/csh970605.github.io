# What is Clustering?<br>

Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset.<br>
It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."
