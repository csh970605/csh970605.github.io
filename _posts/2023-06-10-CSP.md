# What is CSP?
CSP is a concept to solve the problem of replicated gradients. As the solution, input to a dense block of CSP is divided into two parts.
<br>
One is used directly into the concatenation with the final output of the DB+TB chain and the other is used as an input in the dense block like:

By this concept, we can get two advantages.

+ Increasing the gradient flow paths that help in removing the replicated updates of the weights in DenseBlock.

+ Breaking a base layer into two parts helps to decrease the number of multiplications in Dense Block, which further helps in increasing inference speed.
