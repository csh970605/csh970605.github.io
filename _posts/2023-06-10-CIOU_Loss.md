# What is CIOU loss?
CIOU introduces two new concepts compared to [IOU loss](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/IOU_Loss/).<br>

+ The concept of centroid distance, which is the distance between the actual bounding box centroid and the predicted bounding box centroid.

+ Compares the aspect ratio of the actual bounding box with the predicted bounding box aspect ratio.

Through those 3 measures we can get the quality of predicted bounding box.

<br>

So, let's see the formula of CIOU loss.

## Formula of CIOU

<font size=4>

$Loss_{CIoU}\ =\ 1\ -\ IoU\ +\ \frac{p^{2}(b,b^{gt})}{c^{2}}\ +\ \alpha v$<br>

$Loss_{CIoU}\ =\ 1\ -\ \frac{Area\ of\ Overlap}{Area\ of\ Union}\ +\ \frac{p^{2}(b,b^{gt})}{c^{2}}\ +\ \alpha v $

where:<br>

$B^{gt} = (x^{gt}, y^{gt}, w^{gt}, h^{gt})$ is the ground-truth<br>

$B = (x, y, w, h)$ is the predicted box.<br>

c = the diagonal length of the smallest bounding box.<br>

p = Uclidean distance.<br>

$v = \frac{4}{\pi}(arctahn\frac{w^{gt}}{h^{gt}}\ -\ arctahn\frac{w}{h})^{2}$ = measure the consistency of a aspect ratio.<br>

$\alpha= \frac{v}{(1\ -\ IoU) + v} = \frac{v}{(1\ -\ \frac{Area\ of\ Overlap}{Area\ of\ Union}) + v}$
