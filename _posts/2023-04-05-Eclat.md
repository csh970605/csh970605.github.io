# What is Eclat?

The Eclat model serves to review all combinations and tells you which ones to focus on.<br>

The Eclat algorithm has only one part unlike [Apriori](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Apriori/):

+ Support<br>
It's very similar to [Bayes](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Naive_Bayes/). Let's assume that we are doing a movie recommendation.

<center>

$ support(M) = \frac{user\ watchinglists\ containing\ M}{user\ watchlists} $
</center>
<br><br>

Because Eclat doesn't have ["confidence" and "lift"](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Apriori/#what-is-apriori), it makes no sense to look at an item by itself in the Eclat model.
<br><br>

## The order of progression of eclat
---
<br>

+ Step 1.<br>
Set a minimum support.<br>
+ Step 2.<br>
Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than the minimum support.<br>
+ Step 3.<br>
Sort the subsets by decreasing support.
<br><br><br>

# Example
<br><br>

## Code
---
<br>

```py
from apyori import apriori
rules = apriori(
                transactions = transactions, 
                min_support = 0.003, 
                min_confidence = 0.2, 
                min_lift = 3, 
                min_length = 2, 
                max_length = 2)

results = list(rules)

def inspect(results):
    lhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][0])[0] for result in results]
    rhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][1])[0] for result in results]
    supports    = [result[1] for result in results]
    return list(zip(lhs, rhs, supports))
    
resultsinDataFrame = pd.DataFrame(inspect(results), columns = [
                                                                'Product 1', 
                                                                'Product 2', 
                                                                'Support'])

resultsinDataFrame = resultsinDataFrame.nlargest(n = 10, columns = 'Support')                                                               
```
