# What is SSD?

SSD is devised to improve [YOLO](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/YOLO/) that can't detect small things. And SSD has two different things from YOLO which are:<br>

+ Multi Scale Feature Maps

+ Default Boxes Generation

<br><br>

Let's see the shape of SSD before knowing what the two things are.

There is one thing to notice, we should set the number of channels in the output feature map k * (C + 4) where k = the number of default boxes, C = the number of classes to predict.<br>
Then, let's see what the two things are.
<br><br><br>

## Multi Scale Feature Maps
---
<br>

Conv 4_3, 7, 8_2, 9_2, 10_2, 11_2, a total of 6 different scale feature maps are used for prediction.

<br><br><br>

## Default Boxes Generation
---
<br>

Default boxes are the candidate of being bounding box. For example, we create 42 points(grid) to generate 3 default boxes each like:

</center>
<br><br>
And in this step, we set k numbers of default box in order to perform image classification.<br>
Before doing that, we should set Sk which is the size ratio of default box to input image. Sk is calculated by:

<font size=4>

$ S_{k}\ =\ S_{min}\ +\ \frac{S_{max}\ -\ S_{min}}{m\ -\ 1}(k\ -\ 1) $
</font>
</center>
<br><br>
By those processes, we can get a red box that detect person.
