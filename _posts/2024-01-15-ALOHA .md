# ALOHA

ALOHA is an abbreviation of "A Low-cost Open-source HArdware system for bimanual teleoperation".<br>
As the name ALOHA suggests, it is used for fine manipulation tasks.<br>
In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13705), the authors considered how robots can learn effectively at low cost. The answer is : they present a system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface.<br>
However, imitation learning has the problems which are errors in the policy can compound overtime and human demonstrations can be non-stationary.<br>
They present a method to overcome the problems in this paper. Let's see how they tide over it.
