# What is IOU loss?
IOU is a method to address the disadvantage of [L2 Regularization](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/L2_Regularization/) which tends to minimize the error of small objects and maximize the error of big objects. The IoU loss considers the bounding box as a unit instead of optimizing the four coordinates independently. Additionally, it normalizes the IoU to $[0, 1]$ regardless of size.
