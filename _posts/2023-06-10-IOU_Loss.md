# What is IOU loss?
IOU is a method to solve disadvantage of [L2 Regularization](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/L2_Regularization/) that L2 Regularization tends to minimize the error of small object and to maximize the error of big object.<br>
It can be seen that the IoU loss considers the bounding box as a unit instead of optimizing the four coordinates independently. And also it norms IOU to [0, 1] regardless of size.
