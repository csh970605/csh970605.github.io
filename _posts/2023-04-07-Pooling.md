# What is pooling?
If there is no pooling, machines cannot recognize objects that differ only in angle or saturation as the same object.<br>
To solve this problem, we add pooling layer in [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/).
<br>
<br>
Assume that we use **max pooling** to perform pooling on feature map created with[convolutional layer](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Convolution_Operation/).<br>
<br>

feature map:

</center>
<br><br>

We use a 2X2 pixel box to do the pooling. From the top left pixel of the feature map, 2X2 pixel boxes are extracted in order without overlapping.<br>
After that, max pooling is to find and record the maximum value in the pixel box.

What you need to know while performing pooling is that pooling proceeds without concern even if the pixelbox exceeds the range of the feature map like:
