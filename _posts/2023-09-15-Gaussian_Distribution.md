# What is Gaussian Distribution?

Gaussian distribution also known as normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution.<br>
The general form of its [probability density function](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Probability_RandomVector/#probability-density-function) is :

<center>
<font size=4>

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$<br>
</font>
</center>

Where <br>

+ $\mu$ : The mean or expectation of distribution.<br>
+ $\sigma$ : standard deviation.


Since gaussian distribution is calculated by two probability information, that is, expectation and distribution, it is easy to treat mathematically.
