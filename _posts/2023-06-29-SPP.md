# What is SPP?

SPP allows [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/) to be applied regardless of the size of the input image. Then, let's see how SPP works.<br>

At First, SPP gets the feature map extracted through the Conv Layers as input. And then, separates the inputs to predetermined areas. For example, as you can see in the image below, it provides three areas in advance, 4x4, 2x2, and 1x1, each called a pyramid.

<br><br>

At this time, we call the one block of pyramid "bin". For example, if the input size of feature map is (128 * 128 * 256), the bin size of 4*4 pyramid will be (32 * 32).
<br><br>

Each bin performs [max pooling](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Pooling/) and concatenate all the results. At this time, the output of SPP is kM-dimensional vector where k = channel numbers of the input feature map, m = number of bins. So, in the example k = 256, M = (16 + 4 + 1). <br>
<br>

As you can see in the calculation above, whether the size of input feature map is large or not, the shape of the output vector is same. This is why SPP allows CNN to be applied regardless of the size of the input image.
