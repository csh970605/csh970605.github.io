# What is data preprocessing?<br>

Data preprocessing is a important task that must be conducted before a dataset can be used for model training.<br>
Raw data is often noisy and unreliable, and may be missing values. <br>
Using such data for modeling can produce misleading results.<br>
There are more details in the [Data preprocessing](https://csh970605.github.io) post.
