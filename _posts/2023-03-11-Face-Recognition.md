# What is Face Recognition?
<br>
 with the facial images already extracted, cropped, resized and usually converted to grayscale, the face recognition algorithm is responsible for finding characteristics which best describe the image.<br><br>
 
 ## Differences From Face Detection
 <br>
 Face recognition classifies faces with face images extracted from face detection.
<br><br>

# Algorithms
There are two modules:<br>
[LBPH(Local Binary Patterns Histograms)](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/LBPH/)<br>
[Dlib](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/FR_Dlib/)<br>
[CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/)<br>
