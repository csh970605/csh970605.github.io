# What is LBPH?
LBP (Local Binary Patterns) is a feature extraction technique used to recognize or analyze textures in the field of image processing. <br>
LBPH is a technique that combines LBP and a histogram (H).<br><br>
LBP extracts features of an image by converting the pixel values around each pixel in the image into binary numbers like image below.<br>

</center>
Binary numbers are generated based on the relative brightness difference between the center pixel and its neighbors.<br>
If the neighboring pixel's value is larger than the center pixel's value, it is represented as 1, and if it is less than the center pixel'value, it is represented as 0 like image below.<br>

<br>
Using these binary numbers, we can extract texture features for each pixel.<br>
The image below shows the order of extracting binary numbers.

</center>
The result of the value extracted from the image is "11100010" in binary and "226" in decimal. That is, the value of the pixel surrounding 8 in the image is "11100010" in binary and "226" in decimal.<br>
Also, this value does not change even if the brightness of the image is increased.<br>
<br>
Extracting Local Binary Patterns (LBP) can result in specific patterns appearing in specific parts of an image. <br>
It uses these patterns to recognize objects or faces in images.<br>
<br>

# How is LBPH applied to actual images?


## Step 1

<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/225900490-974f53c4-20b8-46b1-a6ff-156424ca9856.png"><br><br>
As you can see in the picture above, algorithm will create several squares.<br>
It should be noted here that a square does not represent a single pixel, but are set with multiple pixels.<br>
In this picture, each square has 12pixels. And then, apply LBP to obtain the value of the central pixel.<br><br>

## Step 2

<br>

Create a histogram, which represent statistics of counts that how many times each color appears in each squares.<br>
The image below is an example of a created histogram.<br>
