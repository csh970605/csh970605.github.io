# What is Apriori?
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning.<br>
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the data set and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the dataset.<br>
<br>
Apriori algorithm has three part:<br>

+ Support<br>
It's very similar to [Bayse](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Naive_Bayes/).<br>
Let's assume that we are doing a moive recommendation.<br>

<font size=5>

$ support(M) = \frac{user\ watchinglists\ containing\ M}{user\ watchlists} $
</font>
</center>

+ Confidence<br>
Confidence is defined as the number of people who have seen the M1 and M2 movies divided by the number of people who have seen the M1 movie.<br>
<center>
<font size=5>

$ confidenc(M_{1} \rightarrow M_{2}) = \frac{user\ watchinglists\ containing\ M_{1} and M_{2}}{user\ watchlists\ containing M_{1}} $
</font>
</center>


+ Lift<br>
<center>
<font size=5>

$ lift(M_{1} \rightarrow M_{2}) = \frac{confidenc(M_{1} \rightarrow M_{2})}{support(M_{2})} $
</font>
</center>

## The order of progression of apriori
---
<br>

+ Step 1.<br>
Set a minimum support and confidence.<br>
+ Step 2.<br>
Take all the subsets in trasactions having higher support than minimum support.<br>
+ Step 3.<br>
Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confdience.<br>
+ Step 4.<br>
Sort the rules by decreasing lift.<br>

# Example

## Code

<br>

```py
from apyori import apriori
rules = apriori(
                transactions=transactions, 
                min_support=0.003, 
                min_confidence=0.2, 
                min_lift=3, 
                min_length=2, 
                max_length=2)

results = list(rules)


def inspect(results):
  lhs = [tuple(result[2][0][0])[0] for result in results]
  rhs = [tuple(result[2][0][1])[0] for result in results]
  supports = [result[1] for result in results]
  confidences = [result[2][0][2] for result in results]
  lifts = [result[2][0][3] for result in results]
  return list(zip(lhs, rhs, supports, confidences, lifts))


resultsinDataFrame = pd.DataFrame(inspect(results), columns = [
                                                                'Left Hand Side', 
                                                                'Right Hand side', 
                                                                'Support', 
                                                                'Confidence', 
                                                                'Lift'])

resultsinDataFrame = resultsinDataFrame.nlargest(n=10, columns='Lift')                                                                
```
