# What is Contours?
Contours are continous lines or curves that bound or cover the full boundary of an object. It can be used as<br>
**cv2.findContours(image, mode, method) -> contours, hierarchy** where<br>
+ image = input image.
+ mode = Contour retrieval mode. There is five algorithms in mode of the contour retrieval
    + RETR_EXTERNAL : Returns only extreme outer flags. All child contours are left behind.
    + RETR_LIST : Retrieves all the contours, but doesn't create any parent-child relationship. Parents and kids are equal under this rule, and they are just contours.
    + RETR_CCOMP : Retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy. <br>
    For example, external contours of the object (its boundary) are placed in hierarchy-1. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in hierarchy-2. If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in hierarchy-1 only. And its hole in hierarchy-2 and so on.
    + RETR_TREE : Retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list.
    + RETR_FLOODFILL
    <br><br>

+ method = Contour approximation method. There are 4 algorithms in the contour approximation method.
    + CHAIN_APPROX_NONE : Stores absolutely all the contour points.
    + CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE : Compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and leaves only their end points.
    + CHAIN_APPROX_TC89_L1 : Applies one of the flavors of the Teh-Chin chain approximation algorithm 
    + CHAIN_APPROX_TC89_KCOS : Applies one of the flavors of the Teh-Chin chain approximation algorithm
    <br><br>

+ contours = Each contour is stored as a vector of points
<br><br>

+ hierarchy = Optional output vector containing information about the image topology. It has as many elements as the number of contours.

## Steps of Contouring

<br>

1. Grayscale
2. [Threshold](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Thresholding/) or [Canny Edge Detection](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Edge_Detecting/) to Binarize image.
