# How to create approximate contours?
We can create approximate contours by<br>
**cv2.approxPolyDP(curve, epsilon, closed)** where<br>

+ curve : a individual [contour](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Contours/) we wish to approximate
+ epsilon :  Important parameter is determining the accuracy of the approximation. Small values give precise- approximations, large values give more generic approximation.<br>
We can get epsilon by <br>
**small number * cv2.arcLength(curve, closed)**
+ closed : a Boolean value that states whether the approximate contour should be open or closed.
<br><br>
<br><br>

# What is Convex Hull?

convex curves are the curves which are always bulged out, or at-least flat. And if it is bulged inside, it is called convexity defects. We can get Convex Hull as:
**cv2.convexHull(points)** where<br>
+ points : a individual contour.
