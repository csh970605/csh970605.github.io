# What is [YOLO](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/YOLO/)v4?
YOLOv4 covers the disadvantage of R-CNN which has row FPS.

However, YOLOv4 is not as accurate as R-CNN. YOLOv4 can be seem it attempted to solve both problems and strike a balance between speed and accuracy.

Then, Let's see how YOLOv4 consists of.

# Structure of YOLOv4

+ Backbone : CSPDarknet53
    
    + BOF for backbone : [CUTMIX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899), mosaic [data augmentation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Data_Augmentation/)

    + BOS for backbone : CSP(Cross-stage partial connections), MiWRC(Multi input weighted residual connections)

+ Neck : SPP(Spatial Pyramid Pooling), PAN(Path Aggregation Network)

+ Head : [YOLOv3](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/YOLOv3/)

    + BOF for detector : CIoU-loss, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, Mosaic data augmentation, Self-Adversarial Training, Eliminate grid sensitivity, Using multiple anchors for a single ground truth, Cosine annealing scheduler, Optimal hyperparameters, Random training shapes.

    + BOS for Detector : [Mish activation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Activation_Function/), SPP-block, SAM-block, PAN path-aggregation block, DIoU-NMS
