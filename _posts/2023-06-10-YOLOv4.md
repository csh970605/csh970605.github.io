# What is [YOLO](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/YOLO/)v4?
YOLOv4 covers the disadvantage of R-CNN which has row FPS and do not require fixed size of input images because of [SPP(Spatial Pyramid Pooling)](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/SPP/).

However, YOLOv4 is not as accurate as R-CNN. YOLOv4 can be seem it attempted to solve both problems and strike a balance between speed and accuracy.
<br>

Then, let's see how YOLOv4 consists of..

# Structure of YOLOv4

+ Backbone : [CSPDarknet53](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CSP/)
    
    + BOF for backbone : [CUTMIX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899), mosaic [data augmentation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Data_Augmentation/)

    + BOS for backbone :[CSP](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CSP/), MiWRC

+ Neck : SPP, modified [PAN(Path Aggregation Network)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00405)

    <br>



+ Head : [YOLOv3](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/YOLOv3/)

    + BOF for detector : [CIoU-loss](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CIOU_Loss/), CmBN, [DropBlock](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/DropBlock/) regularization, Mosaic data augmentation, Self-Adversarial Training, Eliminate grid sensitivity, Using multiple anchors for a single ground truth, Cosine annealing scheduler, Optimal hyperparameters, Random training shapes.

    + BOS for Detector : [Mish activation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Activation_Function/), SPP-block, SAM-block, PAN path-aggregation block, DIoU-NMS

## BOF & BOS
---
<br>

+ BOF = better accuracy, not incerase inference cost conventional object detector.

+ BOS = post-processing methods that increase the inference cost by a small amount but significantly improve the accuracy of object detection
