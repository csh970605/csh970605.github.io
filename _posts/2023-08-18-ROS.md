# What is ROS(Robot Operation System)?

ROS provides various libraries and tools for implementation and debugging.<br>
As the name suggests, you might think that ROS is an Operating System. <br>
However more precisely, ROS is a Middleware or a framework which is a system that executes scheduling, loading, monitoring, and error handling as a virtualization layer between distributed computing resources.<br>
And we call it Meta-Operating System.

## Functions that ROS Provides
---

+ Hardware abstraction

+ Low-level device control

+ Function implementation
    
    + Sensing

    + Detecting

    + Map making(SLAM)

    + Motion planning

+ Message passing between processes

+ Package management

<br><br><br><br>

# Objectives of ROS

+ Distributed process : programs in the smallest units of executable process(Node) and each nodes give and take datas organically while they are executed independently.

+ Manage by package : since ROS manages multiple process(node) with the same purpose by package it is easy to share or redistribution .

+ Open source 

+ API : it is easy to develop a software which utilizes ROS because we can be called by API.

+ Multiple programming language support : ROS supports not only Python, C++, Lisp but also JAVA, C3, Lua, ruby. Therefore, ROS can be developed by familiar programming language.

# Composition of ROS

+ [Client Layer](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Client_Layer/) : supports multiple programming language.

+ [Hardware Interface Layer](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/HI_Layer/) : supports the control of hardware.

+ [Robotics Application](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Robotics_Application/) : application for service.

+ [Robotics Application Framework](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Robotics_Application_Framework/) : supports in the creation of various robotics application.

+ [Communication Layer](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Communication_Layer/) : data communication.

+ [Software Development Tools](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Software_Development_Tools/)

+ [Simulation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Simulation/) : control a robot in a virtual space.
