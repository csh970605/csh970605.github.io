# What is ROS(Robot Operation System)?

ROS provides various libraries and tools for implementation and debugging.<br>
As the name suggests, you might think that ROS is an Operating System. <br>
However more precisely, ROS is a Middleware or a framework which is a system that executes scheduling, loading, monitoring, and error handling as a virtualization layer between distributed computing resources.<br>
And we call it Meta-Operating System.

## Functions that ROS Provides
---

+ Hardware abstraction

+ Low-level device control

+ Function implementation
    
    + Sensing

    + Detecting

    + Map making(SLAM)

    + Motion planning

+ Message passing between processes

+ Package management

## Objectives of ROS
---

+ Distributed process : programs in the smallest units of executable process(Node) and each nodes give and take datas organically while they are executed independently.
