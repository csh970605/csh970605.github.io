# Object Tracking VS Object Detection
+ Tracking algorithms <br>
Tracking algorithms are much faster than detection algorithms because to track an object, the algorithm already knows what it looks like in order to track it in the next frames of the video.

There are more details in [Object Tracking](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Object_Tracking/)post

# KCF(Kernel Correlation Filters)
runs very fast, but the quality is not so good.<br>

# CSRT(Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability)
runs lower speed, but the quality is higher.<br>
