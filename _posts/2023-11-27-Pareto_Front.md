# What is Pareto Front?

The Pareto front, also known as the Pareto frontier or Pareto set, is a concept used in multi objective optimization to describe the set of optimal solutions that represent the best trade-offs among conflicting objectives.<br>

In multi-objective optimization problems, there are often multiple conflicting objectives that need to be considered simultaneously. The Pareto front consists of those solutions for which no improvement in one objective can be achieved without sacrificing the performance in at least one other objective.<br>
Finding the Pareto front is a crucial step in solving multi-objective optimization problems, as it helps decision-makers understand the trade-offs inherent in the system and choose solutions based on their preferences and priorities among conflicting objectives. <br>
Various algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques, are used to identify the Pareto front in complex optimization scenarios.<br>

The image above is an example of a Pareto frontier. The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point C is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point A and point B. Points A and B are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence lie on the frontier.<br>


Key characteristics of the pareto front are:

+ Trade-off Solutions

+ Efficient Solutions

+ Non-Dominated Solutions

+ Diversity of Solutions

+ Visual Representation

## Trade-off Solutions
Each point on the Pareto front represents a solution that is optimal with respect to the given objectives, and any improvement in one objective would necessitate a trade-off in another.

<br><br>

## Efficient Solutions
The Pareto front contains solutions that are Pareto efficient, meaning they cannot be improved in any one objective without degrading at least one other objective.

<br><br>

## Non-Dominated Solutions
Points on the Pareto front are non-dominated by any other feasible solution, meaning there is no other solution that performs better in all objectives.

<br><br>

## Diversity of solutions
The Pareto front may include a diverse set of solutions, providing decision-makers with a range of alternatives based on different objective trade-offs.

<br><br>

## Visual Representation
In visualization, the Pareto front is often depicted as a curve or surface in the objective space, where each point on the front corresponds to a Pareto-optimal solution.
