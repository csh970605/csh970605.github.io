# Algorithms
<br>
There are two algorithms<br><br>

- Casacade Classifier<br>
    + Train positive and negative images to quickly and accurately detect face regions.|<br>
    + There are more details in [Casacade Classifier](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Casacade-Classifier/) post<br>
- HOG(Histograms of Oriented Gradients)
    + A method of extracting a histogram-type feature by considering the angle and size of the pixel variation<br>
    + There are more details in [HOG(Histograms of Oriented Gradients)](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/HOG/) post<br>
