# Terms of ROS

+ Master : Master acts like nameserver for message communication and connection between nodes.<br>
    **rescore** is a run command.<br>
    If master is activated, you can registerate each node's name and get information as you want.<br>
    **Without master, there is no connections between nodes and message communications.**<br>
    Master communicate with the slaves by XMLPRC(XML-Remote Procedure Call), an HTTP-based protocol which does not keep a connection with the slave.

+ Node : Node is a minimum unit processer that runs at ROS. = A executable program. <br>
    That is, Sensor drive, obstacle judgment and motor driving are developed as separate nodes.<br>

    Node uses XMLPRC when communicate with master and uses XMLPRC or TCPROS(TCP/IP based) when communicate with other nodes. More specifically, connection requests and responses between nodes use XMLPRC and message communications use TCPROS

+ Package : Package is the base unit of constructing ROS.

+ Metapackage : A set of packages that have same purpose. <br>
    For example, in Navigation metapackage, it consists of about 10 packages:AMCL, DWA, EKF, map_server, etc.

+ Message : Message is a way to give and take datas between nodes.<br>
    There are two ways of using message:<br>

    + Topic : One-way message transmission.<br>

    + Service : Two-way message request/response.<br>

+ Topic : If the publisher node want to talk about one topic, the publisher will publish the topic. Some node(subscriber) who want to receive the information of the topic can receive the information of publisher node. Based on the information, subscriber can communicate with publisher directly by message.<br>
    Since topic transmission is asynchronous way, it is the great way to send and receive the message.<br>
    Also, It is used for sensor data because it sends and receives continuous messages through a single connection.<br>

+ Publish : Sends the data in the form of message about topic.

+ Publisher node : Registers the information of publisher node itself including topic.

+ Subscribe : Receives the data in the form of message about topic and publisher node.

+ Subscriber node : Gets the message from publisher node directly.

+ Service : Service is a synchronous two-way message communication between service client(request) and service server(response).
    Unlike topic, service is a one-off message communication. When the request and response are complete, the connection between two nodes is disconnected.
