# Master

 Master acts like nameserver for message communication and connection between nodes.<br>
**rescore** is a run command.<br>
If master is activated, you can registerate each node's name and get information as you want.<br>
**Without master, there is no connections between nodes and message communications.**<br>
Master communicate with the slaves by XMLPRC(XML-Remote Procedure Call), an HTTP-based protocol which does not keep a connection with the slave.
<br><br><br><br>


# Node

Node is a minimum unit processer that runs at ROS. = A executable program. <br>
That is, Sensor drive, obstacle judgment and motor driving are developed as separate nodes.<br>
Node uses XMLPRC when communicate with master and uses XMLPRC or TCPROS(TCP/IP based) when communicate with other nodes. More specifically, connection requests and responses between nodes use XMLPRC and message communications use TCPROS.
<br><br><br><br>


# Package

Package is the base unit of constructing ROS.
<br><br><br><br>


# Metapackage

A set of packages that have same purpose. <br>
For example, in Navigation metapackage, it consists of about 10 packages:AMCL, DWA, EKF, map_server, etc.
<br><br><br><br>


# Message 

Message is a way to give and take datas between nodes.<br>
There are two ways of using message:<br>

+ Topic : One-way message transmission.

+ Service : Two-way message request/response.
<br><br>

## Topic

If the publisher node want to talk about one topic, the publisher will publish the topic. Some node(subscriber) who want to receive the information of the topic can receive the information of publisher node. Based on the information, subscriber can communicate with publisher directly by message.<br>
Since topic transmission is asynchronous way, it is the great way to send and receive the message.<br>
Also, It is used for sensor data because it sends and receives continuous messages through a single connection.<br>

+ Publish : Sends the data in the form of message about topic.

+ Publisher node : Registers the information of publisher node itself including topic.

+ Subscribe : Receives the data in the form of message about topic and publisher node.

+ Subscriber node : Gets the message from publisher node directly.
<br><br>

## Service

Service is a synchronous two-way message communication between service client(request) and service server(response).<br>
Unlike topic, service is a one-off message communication. When the request and response are complete, the connection between two nodes is disconnected.

+ Service server : It is a message communication server that takes the request as input and outputs the response.<br>
    All of the requests and reponses are consisted of messages.<br>
        It is used for the node which performs the fixed orders.

+ Service client : It is a message communication client that outputs the request and takes the response from service server as input.<br>
    All of the requests and reponses are consisted of messages.<br>
    It is used for the node which orders the fixed orders and gets the results.
<br><br>

## Action

Action is a message communication method used when two-way communication is required like a service, but it takes a long time from request processing to response and intermediate result values are required.<br>
It is very similiar to the service, but the difference is that requests and responses are turned into goals and results.

+ Action server : Action server is a message communication server that gets goal from action client as input and outputs the result and feedback.<br>
    It is responsible for action execution.

+ Action client : Action client is a message communication client that outputs the goal and gets the result and feedback from action server as input.<br>
    It is responsible for cancel the goal or order the next order.
<br><br><br><br>


# Parameter

Parameter is used in node.<br>
It is very useful because the setting value can be changed in real time according to the situation by using the write function from outside.
<br><br><br><br>

# Parameter server 

Parameter server is a server that registers each parameters when use parameter at parameter server package.<br>
It is a function of master.
<br><br><br><br>

# Catkin

Catkin is a build system of ROS.<br>
It makes it possible to conveniently use ROS-related builds, package management, and dependencies between packages.
