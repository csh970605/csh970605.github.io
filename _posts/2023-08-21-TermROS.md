# Terms of ROS

+ Master : Master acts like nameserver for message communication and connection between nodes.<br>
    **rescore** is a run command.<br>
    If master is activated, you can registerate each node's name and get information as you want.<br>
    **Without master, there is no connections between nodes and message communications.**<br>
    Master communicate with the slaves by XMLPRC(XML-Remote Procedure Call), an HTTP-based protocol which does not keep a connection with the slave.

+ Node : Node is a minimum unit processer that runs at ROS. = A executable program. <br>
    That is, Sensor drive, obstacle judgment and motor driving are developed as separate nodes.<br>

    Node uses XMLPRC when communicate with master and uses XMLPRC or TCPROS(TCP/IP based) when communicate with other nodes. More specifically, connection requests and responses between nodes use XMLPRC and message communications use TCPROS

+ Package : Package is the base unit of constructing ROS.

+ Metapackage : A set of packages that have same purpose. <br>
    For example, in Navigation metapackage, it consists of about 10 packages:AMCL, DWA, EKF, map_server, etc.

+ Message : Message is a way to give and take datas between nodes.<br>
    There are two ways of using message:<br>

    + topic : One-way message transmission

    + service : Two-way message request/response.
