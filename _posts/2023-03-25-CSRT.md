# CSRT(Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability)
Runs lower speed, but the quality is higher.<br>

## How CSRT Works?
---
+ Step 1(Training patch)<br>
Select the object we want to track as you can see in the image below.<br>
And it is related to the information that was selected from the image information about the pixels of the image.<br>
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/227718174-1e62ed67-b956-4d85-9004-1077e9b6dc21.png" height=300 width=300><br>
</center>

+ Step 2(Spatial prior)<br>
Extract useful information of the image by using [HOG](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/HOG/) as you can see image below.<br>
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/227718178-b3e7fb93-d2b7-405c-8562-fa7ea255b79f.png" height=300 width=300><br>
</center>

+ Step 3(Backprojection)<br>
Application of Random Markov Test to genearte probabilities.<br>
As you can see image below, we have the same shpae as the original image as if it were the person's next movement.<br>
In short, **probability will be generated to indicate the person's movement and keep tracking the ojbects.**<br>

</center>

+ Step 4(Posterior)<br>
Training patch masked using the confidence map.<br>
As you can see in the image below, We have only the object with a mask.<br>

<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/227718187-c410b0c1-6777-42e3-af4e-2933b02b8aa5.png" height=300 width=300><br>
</center>

+ Step 5(Overlayed patched)<br>
We have the complete object to be tracked like image below.<br>

<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/227718193-c7b87186-37bf-49cf-911a-4b36e3fcf938.png" height=300 width=300><br>
</center><br><br>

## Example Code<br>
---

## Result<br>
---
As in KCF, a window named ROI selector will appear after existing code above.<br>
At the window, select object which you want to track by mouse like image below.<br>
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/227764927-4f68a123-3778-473d-844e-f2b16a6c8418.png">
</center><br><br>
After selecting the object to be tracked, a screen like the one below will appear.<br>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CHLgnGYrukALeyFfRlMQdX1lT1jbhIGB"><br>
<br>
As you can see in the gif above, CSRT is lower than KCF because the mathematical backgrounds of CSRT is much deeper than KCF.<br>
Although CSRT is slow, it uses a lot of other techniques like the random mark of probabilities and hog.<br><br>
