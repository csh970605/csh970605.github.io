# What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused(pre trained model) as the starting point for a model on a second task.<br>
Pre trained model that called **base model** is used by delete a few last layers. After that, if we want to build [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/), we can build it just connecting the top part of CNN called **head** and the frozen base model.

# What is Fine Tuning?
Fine tuning is more suited for bigger data sets somtimes when the custom data set is pretty different from the image and data set.<br>
Fine tuning is similar to Transfer Learning except the base model is half frozen.
