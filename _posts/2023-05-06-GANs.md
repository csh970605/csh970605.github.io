# What is GANs(Generative adversarial Networks)?
GANs generate new images that have never existed in the past. <br>
GANs are formed of two competing networks known as the [generator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/GGANs/) and [discriminator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/DGANs/).<br>

Generator and discriminator teach them together through generator learns from feedback of discriminator. And the generator goes better and better in faking images. At the end, the discriminator cannot be able to find differences between real images and fake images. <br>
If then, we can just take that generator deployed in practice to generate new images.<br>
