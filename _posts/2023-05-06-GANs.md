# What is GANs(Generative adversarial Networks)?
GANs generate new images that have never existed in the past. <br>
GANs are formed of two competing networks known as the [generator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/GGANs/) and [discriminator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/DGANs/).<br>

<br>
Generator and discriminator teach them together through generator learns from feedback of discriminator. And the generator goes better and better in faking images. At the end, the discriminator cannot be able to find differences between real images and fake images. <br>
If then, we can just take that generator deployed in practice to generate new images.<br>


# Steps of training GANs
<br><br>

 + Step 1.<br>
 The geneartor takes in a random noise and generate fake images.

</center>
<br><br>

 + Step 2.<br>
 Both fake images and real images are fed to the discriminator network(feedforward path).

</center>
<br><br>
 
 + Step 3.<br>
The discriminator will generate predictions based on the input images(both real images and fake images).

</center>
<br><br>

 + Step 4.<br>
 The predictions of discriminator are compared to the true labels to calculate the error.

 + Step 5.<br>
 The error is [backpropagated](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Back_Propagation/) through the network to update the discriminator weights.

</center>
<br><br>

+ Step 6. <br>
The discriminator gives feedbacks to the generator how far off the generator is from generating real images.

</center>
<br><br>

+ Step 7.<br>
The generator weights are updated while the discriminator weights are frozen.
