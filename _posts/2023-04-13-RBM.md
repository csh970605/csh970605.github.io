# What is Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM)
RBM is devised to overcome the limitation of computation. The reason for increasing the amount of computationis that there are too many nodes to calculate when the Boltzmann machine is applied in practice. So, for simplicity, RBM is devised.
<br>
The simple structure of RBM:

Boltzmann machine and RBM is mostly similar, but there are no connections between hidden nodes. Also, there are no connections between visible nodes.
<br><br><br>

## How is RBM used?

<br>

Let's assume we are making a movie recommendation system.<br>
During training of the RBM, we can help the Boltzmann machine represent our system by feeding it data through a process called [contrast divergence]().<br>
Through this process, RBM understand how to allocate hiddennodes to specific features. This process is similar to [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN).<br>
<br>
For example, there are review scores about Moive 1~6.<br>

</center>
<br><br>
If user liked the movie, score will be 1. If not, score will be 0. There is also a blank, meaning that user did not see that movie.<br><br>
By feeding this data into the limiting Boltzmann machine, the machine understands our system better, and as it adjusts itself, it can better represent our system and better understand and express the connectivity within it, because users have biases and tastes, and that's reflected in this data.<br><br>

Let's take a simple example.<br>
Movies 3, 4, and 6 generally have similar ratings. Most, but not always, user who liked movies 3 and 4 also liked movie 6, and user who liked movies 6 and 4 or 6 and 3 probably rated movies 4 or 3. If user liked 6 and 3, user will like 4, and if you didn't like movies 3 and 4, user will  hate 6 too.<br>
From this similarity, we can extract features that movies have in common.
<br><br>
Then, let's see the steps that happen in RBM.

We can guess the user likes "Drama" because the user likes "Forrest Gump" and "Titanic". Based on that, "Drama" node is activated.

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user doesn't like "Action" because the user likes "The Matrix" and "Pulp Fiction". Based on that, "Action" node is deactivated.

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Dicaprio" because the user likes "Titanic". Based on that, "Dicaprio" node is activated.

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Oscar" because the user likes "Forrest Gump" amd "Titanic". Based on that, "Oscar" node is activated.

<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Dicaprio" because the user doesn't like "Pulp Fiction". Based on that, "Tarantino" node is deactivated.

The above process is called pass. And it is the first pass. All visible nodes are connected to hidden nodes and we knows which hidden nodes are activated.<br>
Now, the backward pass happens. RBM is going to reconstruct inputs.
