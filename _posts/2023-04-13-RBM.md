# What is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
RBM is devised to overcome the limitations of computation. The reason for the increased amount of computation is that there are too many nodes to calculate when the Boltzmann machine is applied in practice. So, for simplicity, RBM is devised.
<br>
The simple structure of RBM:

</center>
<br><br>
The Boltzmann machine and RBM are mostly similar, but there are no connections between hidden nodes. Also, there are no connections between visible nodes.
<br><br><br>

## How is RBM used?
---
<br>

Let's assume we are making a movie recommendation system.<br>
During training of the RBM, we can help the Boltzmann machine represent our system by feeding it data through a process called [contrast divergence](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Contrastive_Divergence/). Through this process, RBM understands how to allocate hidden nodes to specific features. This process is similar to [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN).<br>
<br>
For example, there are review scores about Moive 1 to 6.<br>
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/231678815-e1464789-42fc-4fbd-982d-b199dedab9d4.png" width=500>
</center>
<br><br>
If the user liked the movie, the score will be 1. If not, the score will be 0. There is also a blank, meaning that the user did not see that movie. By feeding this data into the limiting Boltzmann machine, the machine understands our system better, and as it adjusts itself, it can better represent our system and better understand and express the connectivity within it, because users have biases and tastes, and that's reflected in this data.<br><br>

Let's take a simple example.<br>
Movie 3, 4, and 6 generally have similar ratings. Most, but not always, user who liked Movie 3 and 4 also liked Movie 6, and user who liked Movie 6 and 4 or 6 and 3 probably rated Movie 4 or 3. If the user liked 6 and 3, user will like 4, and if the user didn't like Movie 3 and 4, the user will hate 6 too.<br>
From this similarity, we can extract features that movies have in common.
<br><br>
Now, let's see the steps that happen in RBM.

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Drama" because the user likes "Forrest Gump" and "Titanic". Based on that, "Drama" node is activated.

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user doesn't like "Action" because the user likes "The Matrix" and "Pulp Fiction". Based on that, "Action" node is deactivated.
<center>

</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Dicaprio" because the user likes "Titanic". Based on that, "Dicaprio" node is activated.
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/231744228-3a120e0b-2a4a-4d04-8922-982970a644ac.png" width=600>
</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Oscar" because the user likes "Forrest Gump" amd "Titanic". Based on that, "Oscar" node is activated.
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/231745137-5a8515b8-e55a-42ae-b338-b478ad8e4a71.png" width=600>
</center>
<br><br>
We can guess the user likes "Dicaprio" because the user doesn't like "Pulp Fiction". Based on that, "Tarantino" node is deactivated.
<center>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28240052/231745299-4dc2c838-a8cb-4e3f-9959-70e5ddf7be7d.png" width=600>
</center>
<br><br>
The above process is called a pass, and it is the first pass. All visible nodes are connected to hidden nodes and we knows which hidden nodes are activated.Next, the backward pass occurs. The RBM will reconstruct the inputs.<br>
<br>

During testing, there is no process of adjusting weights. That is, **the weights are never modified** basically. It just gets a vector as input and tries to fill in the empty values in the vector. In the image above, RBM fills in "Fight Club" and "The Departed".<br>
<br>

Then, let's see which features does "Fight Club" and "The Departed" have.

| Movies | Drama | Action | Dicaprio | Oscar | Tarantino|
| --- | --- | --- |--- |---|---|
| Fight Club | X | O | X | X | X |
| The Departed| O | O | O | O | X |

<br>
according to the table above, we can get predicted values of "Fight Club" and "The Departed".
