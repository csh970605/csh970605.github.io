# What is generator in [GANs](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/GANs/)?

Generator tries to make fake images from real images by taking in a random noise signal and output images. And it's objective is to fool [discriminator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/DGANs/).<br>
Labels of generator are marked as:
+ Label = 1.0 : indicates real images.
+ Label = 0.0 : indicates fake images.

The neural network of generator usually be used reversed [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/).
