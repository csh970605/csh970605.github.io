# What is a generator in [GANs](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/GANs/)?

The generator tries to create fake images from random noise signals and outputs images. Its objective is to fool the [discriminator](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/DGANs/). The labels of the generator are marked as:
+ Label = 1.0 : indicates real images.
+ Label = 0.0 : indicates fake images.

The neural network of the generator is usually a reversed [CNN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/CNN/).
