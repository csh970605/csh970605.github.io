# Random Vector

A random vector is a vector consisting of random variables. When the element consist the vecotr $X$ is $X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X{n}$, the probability distribution function is defined as formula [1].

<p align="center">
    <span>$F_{X_{1},...,X_{n}}(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) = P {X_{1} \leq x_{1}, ..., X_{n} \leq x_{n}}$</span>
    <span style="float: right;">[1]</span>
