# What is Auto Encoder?
Auto encoder is an unsupervised deep learning that is used for recommendation systems.<br>
Auto encoder encodes itself. So, auto encoder takes some inputs, put it to the hidden layer, and then gets the outputs with the same number as the inputs.<br>

Here is a simple structure of auto encoder:

Auto encoder is directed types of neural network unlike [boltzmann machine](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Boltzmann_Machine/).<br>
