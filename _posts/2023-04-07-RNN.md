# What is RNN?
RNN is one of the the supervised deeplearning and used for time series analysis.<br>

The basic structure of RNN looks like:

</center>
<br><br>
The hidden layers(the blue circles) not only give output but also feed back itself.<br>

Then, how does RNN update weights? Same as ANN, RNN use [backpropagation](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/Back_Propagation/).

<br><br>

But, there are some problems while update weights($W_{rec}$).<br>

</center>

Because the weights($W_{rec}$) are usually less than 1, it takes many epochs to update the weights in the back. And also, as the weight goes to the backward input, the effect on the output becomes smaller.<br>
This problem is called **vanishing**.<br>
On the other way, if the weights($W_{rec}$) are more than 1, it is called **exploding**.<br>
I will introduce the way to solve vanishing and exploding below.

+ One to Many<br>
It can be used to make sentences with a picture.

<br><br>

+ Many to One<br>
It can be used to classify whether the setence is positive or not.

# Ways to solve vanishing and exploding
<br>
<br>

## Vanishing

There are three ways to solve vanishing<br>

+ Weight initialization<br>
+ Echo state networks<br>
+ [Long Short-Term Memory Networks(LSTM)](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/LSTM/)

<br><br>

## Exploding

+ Truncated Backpropagation<br>
+ Penalties<br>
+ Gradient Clipping<br>
