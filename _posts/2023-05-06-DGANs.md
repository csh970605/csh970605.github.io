# What is discriminator in [GANs](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/GANs/)?

Discriminator is a basic [ANN](https://csh970605.github.io/posts/ANN/) that is trained to perform classification task. Discriminator is trained to do:
+ Ouput = 0(probability = 0%) : The input image is fake.
+ Output = 1(probability = 100%) : The input image is real.
